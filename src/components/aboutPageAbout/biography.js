                My name is Ryan and I was born on a farm in Iowa. I grew up surrounded by nature, exploring &amp; connecting to it often. Nature reminded me of who I really am and helped me to ground into my body. It was challenging for me to focus my thoughts, ignore distractions and regulate my emotions. This effected my ability to learn in school, performance at work or connect in relationships. But later on I discovered strength training at the gym and biking and walking improved my focus and ability to regulate my emotions! At age 18 I discovered Yoga and learned a series of Hatha yoga stretches that helped me to open up and release tension and stress stuck in my body, mind and emotions. Later on I moved to Boulder, Colorado in 2005 to be closer to nature and mountains and continue practicing Yoga. In 2014 I began a consistent meditation practice starting at 1 minute and today I practice 20-30 minutes. It has been so healing in my life and supporting me through transitions and difficult times. Yoga, Strength training, Cardio, and Meditation also helped me heal through 2 accidents: (Broken Elbow 2014) and (Broken right hand/torn ligaments 2020). I became a Yoga Teacher in 2016 and discovered that I didnâ€™t have to be super-flexible to teach and that this practice was good for everyone (while respecting range of motion and using modifications). Yoga just makes one feel better afterwards, more connected, releasing stress and tension and improves breathing and circulation in the body. And today science can also prove these health benefits and more. I know that this has been my path and journey in life and Im meant to share with others. To guide others through their transitions in life that we are all on. So thank you from the deepest part of my heart.
