                What Mindfulness Means to Me
            </h1>
            <p className="aboutText">
                Conscious awareness of the breath relaxes the body, emotions, mind and nervous system. Bringing us into the present moment. Most people and including myself for many years are stuck in the “loop of our thoughts” and in the past &amp; future distracting us from the freedom and peace of being in the present. We can practice mindfulness in everyday life and in movement (practices like yoga) or by sitting in meditation to build up this awareness and let go of the stress, anxiety and trauma stored in our body.
