                            Going out in nature can be one of the most healing things we can do for our body, mind & emotions right now. Iâ€™m hosting several partial day nature retreats in September and October. Guiding us into nature to feel the colder water, ground into the earth, and be with the plants, air and sky. The retreats are composed of prep, meeting at location, breathing exercises, cold water dip, yoga based movements, and discussion.
